# my-portfolio
## Description

I created this webpage to serve as a portfolio of my own work throughout this course. I used everything I have learned in the first two weeks of this bootcamp to create this webpage. I will be updating the webpage periodically throughout the duration of this bootcamp to ensure that it is presentable and current for any future employers viewing.
